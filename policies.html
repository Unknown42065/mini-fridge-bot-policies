            <p class="text-sm italic text-gray-500">**Last Updated:** September 27, 2025</p>

            <p>By inviting **The Fridge** bot ("The Bot") to your Discord server or by interacting with its features and commands, you agree to these Terms of Service (ToS) and acknowledge that you have read and understood our Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>The Fridge is an automated moderation, security, and utility bot designed to assist server administrators in maintaining a safe, compliant, and well-managed Discord server environment. The Bot's primary features include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Automated Moderation:** Spam detection, NSFW content filtering (via Sightengine), anti-ghost ping, and anti-raid protection.</li>
                <li>**Server Management:** Whitelisting users from moderation, DDoS quarantine controls, and member count tracking.</li>
                <li>**Administrative Tools:** Commands for clearing strikes, performing manual quarantines, and server lockdown/unlock (<code>/panic</code>, <code>/unpanic</code>).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Usage and Acceptance</h2>

            <h3>2.1 Restriction of Use</h3>
            <p class="text-red-600 font-semibold border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-3 py-1 bg-red-50">
                **The Fridge Bot is intended for private use only.**
                Unless you have been explicitly invited by the owner and granted access to this bot, **you are not authorized to use or invite this bot to any Discord server.** Unauthorized usage will result in the immediate and permanent termination of service for the server, and the bot will be removed.
            </p>

            <h3>2.2 Administrator Responsibility</h3>
            <p>The server administrator(s) who invite The Bot are responsible for configuring and using the Bot's commands, including all automated moderation settings. You agree that The Fridge is merely a tool, and the consequences of its configuration are ultimately the responsibility of the server staff.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Server Requirements</h3>
            <p>You must ensure your server settings, roles, and channel permissions are configured correctly to allow The Bot to function as intended. We are not responsible for unintended actions or errors caused by conflicting permissions.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Acceptable Use</h3>
            <p>You agree not to use The Bot to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interfere with or circumvent The Bot's security or moderation features.</li>
                <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users or server staff.</li>
                <li>Attempt to crash, interrupt, or degrade The Bot's services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>

            <p>The Fridge Bot is provided "as is" without any guarantees or warranties. We are not liable for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Moderation Errors:** Any false positives (accidental timeouts, kicks, or message deletions) that occur due to automated moderation systems.</li>
                <li>**Downtime:** Any interruption, downtime, or temporary unavailability of the Bot.</li>
                <li>**Data Loss:** Any loss of data (e.g., strike counts, whitelist configuration) due to unforeseen errors or database failure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Termination</h2>

            <p>We reserve the right to remove The Bot from any server or permanently ban any user from using the Bot's services without prior notice, at our sole discretion, for any reason, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Unauthorized Use (Violation of 2.1).**</li>
                <li>Violation of these ToS or the Privacy Policy.</li>
                <li>Violation of the Discord Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.</li>
                <li>Abusive behavior toward The Bot or its developers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Changes to the Terms</h2>

            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of The Bot after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

            <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold border-b-2 pb-2 mb-4 mt-6 text-gray-800">The Fridge Bot - Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p class="text-sm italic text-gray-500">**Last Updated:** September 27, 2025</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how **The Fridge** bot ("The Bot") collects, uses, and stores data from Discord users and servers.</p>

            <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>

            <p>The Bot only collects and stores data that is strictly necessary for its security, moderation, and core functionality.</p>

            <h3>1.1 Server Data (Required for Operation)</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data Collected</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                        <th>Retention Period</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>**Server IDs (Guild IDs)**</td>
                        <td>To identify the server, locate the log channel, and apply server-specific settings (e.g., quarantine state).</td>
                        <td>Retained while The Bot is in the server.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>**Channel IDs & Role IDs**</td>
                        <td>To correctly configure and apply moderation actions (e.g., log channel, quarantined role, member count channel).</td>
                        <td>Retained while The Bot is in the server.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>1.2 User Data (Required for Moderation and Security)</h3>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Data Collected</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>

                    </tr>
                </thead>

                    <tr>
                        <td>**User IDs**</td>
                        <td>To track user activity for **spam detection** (<code>spam_detector</code> map), track strikes for **NSFW offenses** (<code>NSFW_STRIKES</code> map), and maintain the **Whitelist** (<code>WHITELISTED_USERS</code> list).</td>
                        <td>**Temporary:** Spam and activity data is cleared within 10-15 seconds. **Persistent:** NSFW strike counts and Whitelist IDs are stored indefinitely until manually cleared by an administrator or the user leaves the server.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>**Message Content/URLs**</td>
                        <td>To check messages for **spam** (rate limiting), detect **ghost pings**, and send **image/GIF URLs** to the **Sightengine API** for NSFW filtering.</td>
                        <td>**Ephemeral:** Message content is not logged or stored, except for the **Sightengine API** check, which uses the URL only. Message data for ghost ping detection is deleted from the Bot’s internal cache within seconds.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>2. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>

            <p>The Fridge utilizes the **Sightengine API** for advanced NSFW and content filtering.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a user sends a message with an image or GIF URL, that **URL** (not the user ID or server ID) is sent to the Sightengine API for analysis.</li>
                <li>The results of the analysis (e.g., a high score for "sexual activity") are used only to determine if the message should be deleted and if a strike should be applied.</li>
                <li>We do not share any other user data (IDs, names, messages) with Sightengine or any other third party.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Data Deletion and Removal</h2>

            <h3>3.1 Server Removal</h3>
            <p>If The Bot is removed from a Discord server, all associated Server IDs, Channel IDs, Role IDs, and the server's specific configuration data will be **automatically deleted** from our storage.</p>

            <h3>3.2 User Data Removal</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>**Administrators** can manually remove a user's persistent data (NSFW strikes) using the <code>/clear-strikes</code> command.</li>
                <li>User IDs stored in the Whitelist can be removed using the <code>/remove-whitelist</code> command.</li>
                <li>Ephemeral data (spam history, ghost ping cache) is **automatically deleted** in real-time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Contact Information</h2>

            <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the data collected by The Fridge, please contact the developer via Discord or through the support channels provided on the server where the Bot is hosted.</p>
